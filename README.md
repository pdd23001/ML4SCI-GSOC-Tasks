# QML-HEP-GSOC-Tasks

These are my tasks for the ML4SCI GSOC project titled "Q-MAML - Quantum Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Variational Quantum Algorithms for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC".
There is an ipynb notebook consisting of the full notebook (.ipynb) with the code and full outputs as they are scrollable in ipynb files. Just in case needed, I have also incuded a PDF but the full output could not be captured in it because it was too long. But that should be fine since the entire output is included in ipynb file
